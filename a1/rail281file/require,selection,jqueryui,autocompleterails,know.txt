I would like to require that a selection from the suggestion list be used as the final value entered.

I see:  [https://github.com/bigtunacan/rails-jquery-autocomplete#running-custom-code-on-selection](https://github.com/bigtunacan/rails-jquery-autocomplete#running-custom-code-on-selection)

and I looked at:
[this ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18720359/jquery-autocomplete-force-choice)
[this](http://jsfiddle.net/7KdZP/2/)
[and this ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11681292/jquery-autocomplete-how-to-force-selection-from-list-keyboard)

I put this in `product1.js`

```
$('#type_name').bind('railsAutocomplete.select', function(event, data){
    focus: function(e, ui) {
      return false;
  }
});
```
I get an error:  `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (` for line 2.

I don't seem to understand how to do this, or even if it can be done this way or any other way.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.

I was reading some posts and tried this in product1.js :

```
$(function() {
  
  // run when eventlistener is triggered
  // http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6431459/jquery-autocomplete-trigger-change-event
  //
  $("#product_type_name").on( "autocompletechange", function(event,data) {
     // post value to console for validation
     console.log("Item is: ", $(this).val());

    // if item user typed in the input box is not in the list of suggestions, it will be cleared out. The user must select an item.
    if (!data.item) {
        this.value = '';
        console.log('> Item selected is:', data.item);
        }
        
    });   
    console.log ("msg.. 1012")  
     
});
```

It is working. 
Is what I have done OK or poorly done?
